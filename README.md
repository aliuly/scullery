Utility for executing Cloud related recipes

Most of the recipes in scullery require admin access.

## TODO

- [x] kurotc ops -- shouldn't require admin access
  - start, stop, list-status
- [x] list flavors, deh types
- [x] list OS images
- [x] reset password
  - seems to work *once* and need to wait before re-use.
- [ ] upload to bucket
- [ ] import OS images
- [ ] format specification/JSON/YAML
